# GameDev
A collection of the games I have worked on: forestree. Wi2ards, Desert Drift, and Air-O-Space

This repo is an overview of each of my gamedev projects. Unfortunately, I cannot host the source code for these out of respecting my teammates wishes, and contractual obligations but I still think it is worth demonstrating them here for my portfolio. If you are an interested collaborator or potential employer, I would be happy to share elements of the code privately.

My first full fledged release which I solo-developed, and was released in partnership with (tentree)[https://www.tentree.com/].
As I've stated elsewhere in my profile, I am deeply passionate about how software can be a tool for social good. I decided to integrate this passion with my long-time hobby of game development to create a charity-forward game-dev studio: (Give Grow Games.)[givegrow.games] The idea is that each game we make has philanthropy integrated into its DNA.

forestree. is a mobile puzzle game centered around planting trees both virtually and around the world! Strategically build the ultimate ecosystem by placing wildlife and plant life across unique biomes.
